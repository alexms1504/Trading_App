# Market Scanner Cancellation Fix

## Problem
The market screener was encountering an error when trying to cancel scanner subscriptions. The issue was that the code was attempting to use `cancelScannerSubscription()` with a `ScannerSubscription` object, but this method expects a different parameter based on the actual IB API implementation.

## Root Cause Analysis
After reviewing the ib_async scanner example from the GitHub repository, the issue was identified:

1. **Wrong cancellation approach**: The code was trying to cancel using `ib.cancelScannerSubscription(self.active_subscription)` where `active_subscription` is a `ScannerSubscription` object.

2. **Misunderstanding API patterns**: The ib_async library uses different methods for different types of scanner operations:
   - `reqScannerData()`: One-time scanner request (no cancellation needed)
   - `reqScannerSubscription()`: Continuous scanner subscription (requires cancellation with scan data object)

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes

1. **Clarified Scanner Usage Pattern**:
   - The current implementation uses `reqScannerData()` which is a one-time request
   - One-time requests don't require cancellation as they complete immediately
   - Added proper state management to track subscription type

2. **Fixed Cancellation Logic**:
   ```python
   def stop_screening(self):
       """Stop real-time screening"""
       try:
           # For reqScannerData (one-time requests), no cancellation needed
           # Just clear the state
           if self.is_running:
               logger.info("Stopping market screener")
                   
           self.is_running = False
           self.active_subscription = None
           self.scan_data = None
           self.current_results.clear()
           self.use_subscription = False
   ```

3. **Added Proper State Management**:
   - Added `scan_data` attribute to store scanner data objects when needed
   - Added `use_subscription` flag to track subscription mode
   - Improved error handling and logging

4. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**:
   - All existing methods continue to work
   - No breaking changes to the public API
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

### Files Modified

1. **`/mnt/c/Users/alanc/OneDrive/桌面/Python_Projects/trading_app/src/core/market_screener.py`**:
   - Fixed cancellation logic in `stop_screening()`
   - Added proper state management
   - Improved error handling
   - Clarified scanner request patterns

### Testing

Created test script `test_scanner_fix.py` to validate:
- Async scanner start/stop operations
- Sync scanner start/stop operations  
- Scanner refresh functionality
- Error handling and state management

## API Reference - Scanner Methods in ib_async

Based on the research from the ib_async documentation:

### One-time Scanner Requests
```python
# Create subscription object
sub = ScannerSubscription(
    instrument='STK',
    locationCode='STK.US.MAJOR', 
    scanCode='TOP_PERC_GAIN'
)

# Request data (one-time, no cancellation needed)
scan_results = ib.reqScannerData(sub)
```

### Continuous Scanner Subscriptions
```python
# For continuous updates (if implemented)
scan_data = ib.reqScannerSubscription(sub)

# Cancel subscription using the returned scan_data object
ib.cancelScannerSubscription(scan_data)
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Cancellation Errors**: No more errors when stopping the market screener
2. **Cleaner Code**: Proper separation between one-time requests and subscriptions
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error recovery
4. **Future-Proof**: Ready for potential upgrade to continuous subscriptions
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features continue to work

## Usage Notes

- The market screener now uses one-time scanner requests by default
- No cancellation is needed for one-time requests
- The `stop_screening()` method safely clears all state
- All existing callback and update mechanisms continue to work
- For real-time continuous updates, consider implementing periodic refresh calls

## Testing Instructions

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_scanner_fix.py
```

This will test all scanner operations and confirm the cancellation error is resolved.
