# Architecture Changes Log

## January 18, 2025 - Architecture Simplification Phase 1

### Overview
Started Phase 0 of the Multi-Symbol Monitoring project by simplifying the over-engineered architecture. Focus on removing dead code and consolidating duplicate functionality.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Features Layer ✅
- **What**: Deleted entire `src/features/` directory (11 files)
- **Why**: Completely unused - UI controllers call services directly
- **Impact**: Reduced code by ~2,000 lines, eliminated confusion about which layer to use
- **Files removed**:
  - connection/: connection_manager.py, connection_dialog.py, connection_monitor.py
  - market_data/: data_manager.py, data_cache.py, market_scanner.py, price_processor.py
  - trading/: order_builder.py, order_validator.py, position_tracker.py, trade_manager.py

#### 2. Consolidated Loggers ✅
- **What**: Reduced from 3 logger implementations to 1
- **Why**: Multiple loggers caused confusion and maintenance overhead
- **Kept**: `src/utils/logger.py` (has color output, file logging, used by 30+ files)
- **Removed**:
  - `src/utils/app_logger.py` - Qt-integrated logger (unused)
  - `src/utils/simple_logger.py` - Test logger (unused)
- **Migration**: Updated imports in base_service.py and connection_service.py

#### 3. Removed Unused Service ✅
- **What**: Deleted `src/services/price_cache_service.py`
- **Why**: Not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- **Impact**: One less service to maintain

### Architecture Evolution

**Before (6 layers)**:
```
UI → Controller → Feature → Service → Core → IB API
```

**Current (~4 layers)**:
```
UI → Controller → Service → Core → IB API
```

**Target (3 layers)**:
```
UI → Service → IB API
```

### Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Reduction |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Total Files | ~75 | ~61 | 19% |
| Feature Files | 11 | 0 | 100% |
| Logger Files | 3 | 1 | 67% |
| Service Files | 14 | 13 | 7% |
| Lines of Code | ~25,000 | ~20,000 | 20% |

### Safety Measures

1. **Quarantine Strategy**: Moved files to `_quarantine/` instead of deleting
2. **Testing**: Application tested and working after each change
3. **Git History**: All changes tracked for easy rollback if needed

### Next Steps

1. **Add Safety Features** (Priority)
   - Fix risk calculator silent failures
   - Add daily loss circuit breaker
   - Add position concentration limits

2. **Continue Simplification** (Optional)
   - Simplify ServiceRegistry → Factory pattern
   - Replace EventBus with Qt signals (high risk)
   - Merge more services

### Lessons Learned

1. **Features layer was completely dead code** - nobody was using it
2. **Logger consolidation was straightforward** - only 2 files had fallback imports
3. **Incremental approach works** - test after each change
4. **Documentation is critical** - update as you go

### Files in Quarantine

Located in `_quarantine/`:
- features_2025_01_18/ (entire features directory)
- app_logger.py
- simple_logger.py  
- price_cache_service.py

These can be permanently deleted after 1 week of stable operation.
