## Key Architectural Decisions

### Confirmed Approach
1. ✅ **TA Library**: Use existing libraries, not build from scratch
2. ✅ **Provider Switch**: Configuration change acceptable (not runtime)
3. ✅ **Order Flow**: Supplementary monitoring, user maintains control
4. ✅ **Criteria**: Universal for all symbols (not per-symbol)
5. ✅ **Integration**: Use existing OrderService and RiskService
6. ✅ **Charting**: Prepare for matplotlib replacement

### Abstraction Layers
- **Data Provider**: Simple interface, config-based switching
- **Pattern Detection**: Wrapper around TA libraries
- **Services**: Minimal new services, use existing where possible
- **UI Integration**: Pre-fill only, no automatic execution
