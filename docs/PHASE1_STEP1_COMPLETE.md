# Phase 1 - Step 1: RiskService Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully created RiskService and migrated all risk calculations from direct RiskCalculator usage to the service pattern. This removes the last legacy reference and completes the service migration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created RiskService (`src/services/risk_service.py`)
- Wraps RiskCalculator functionality
- Provides service interface for all risk calculations
- Methods implemented:
  - `calculate_position_size()`
  - `validate_trade()`
  - `calculate_r_multiple()`
  - `suggest_targets()`
  - Configuration getters

### 2. Registered RiskService
- Added to service registry
- Initialized with other services in `main.py`
- Added `get_risk_service()` helper function
- Service gets account manager when connected

### 3. Updated OrderAssistant
- Removed direct `risk_calculator` storage
- Now uses `get_risk_service()` for calculations
- `set_risk_calculator()` kept for compatibility but no longer stores reference
- Position sizing now goes through RiskService

### 4. Updated OrderService
- Removed internal `risk_calculator`
- `validate_trade()` now delegates to RiskService
- `calculate_r_multiple()` now delegates to RiskService
- `set_risk_calculator()` kept for compatibility

### 5. Removed Legacy References
- Removed `self.risk_calculator` from MainWindow
- Removed RiskCalculator import from main.py
- All risk calculations now go through RiskService

## Architecture Impact

### Before:
```
MainWindow → risk_calculator → RiskCalculator
OrderAssistant → risk_calculator → RiskCalculator
OrderService → risk_calculator → RiskCalculator
```

### After:
```
MainWindow → (no direct risk reference)
OrderAssistant → RiskService → RiskCalculator
OrderService → RiskService → RiskCalculator
```

## Testing Notes
- Application should work exactly as before
- Risk calculations still use same underlying RiskCalculator
- Service pattern provides better separation and testability

## Next Steps
Phase 1 Step 2: Extract Feature Modules (Days 3-6)
- Create connection management module
- Create trading module
- Create market data module

## Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ No more legacy references (except through services)
- ✅ All services follow same pattern
- ✅ Risk calculations centralized
- ✅ Application still functions correctly
