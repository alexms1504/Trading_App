## Original Requirements
I am building a trading app in python with 3 major functions: 

**General requirements:** 
- low latency (<300ms)
- clean and well organized, easy to fix bug
- error handling to make
- safety net to make sure it won't accidentally place orders that may result in huge loss
- create unit test to make sure it's working fine

**Package requirements:**
Please use ib_async package (docs: https://ib-api-reloaded.github.io/ib_async/api.html#, installed location: C:\Users\alanc\anaconda3\envs\ib_trade\Lib\site-packages\ib_async, github: https://github.com/ib-api-reloaded/ib_async) to interact with IBKR TWS API. Use lightweight-charts-python package (github: https://github.com/louisnw01/lightweight-charts-python, installed location: C:\Users\alanc\anaconda3\envs\ib_trade\Lib\site-packages\lightweight_charts) to build the charting functions. Use PyQt6 for the ui framework.

**Function requirements:**
1. Order Assistant - a UI that help me to execute my day-trading bracket orders much faster, and make sure the capability to all in other other type execution in future.
 - input fields, they should all be manually adjustable: 
    - STOCK CODE, 
    - DIRECTION: LONG OR SHORT (DEFAULT LONG)
    - ORDER TYPE: LMT OR MARKET, deciding how the parent order is place, default LMT, 
    - ENTRY PRICE
    - STOP LOSS PRICE
    - TAKE PROFIT PRICE by default 25%, 
    - risk per trade %(default 0.3%)
    - order qty - calculated base on $ risk per trade, (E.G def calc_qty(entry: float, stop: float, risk: float) -> int: return floor(risk / abs(entry - stop))
    - portfolio $ size, default showing account value
 - info fields: 
    -connected ibkr account id 
    -current pending orders base on input value to be submitted

controls: 
SL type (low of prior 5min bar, low of day, low of prior day, manual),
fetch last price a button that update the price of the stock immediately for the input fields, entry and sl and tp price and corresponding qty
submit bracket order button - place the bracket order to tws

Behavior: after I fill in stock code, e.g. AAPL, - it automatically help me to fill in below info:
set entry price (default LATEST PRICE),
set stop loss price, based on selected can select SL type, by default low of prior 5mins bar
re-calculate order qty in real-time if any of the input field changed

2. Screener - a table showing list of us-stock with highest % gain on the day using the screener function in tws, update every 5s in real-time filtered to be adjusted on the screener: -$ volume, default $8M
stock min price, default $0.4
% up criteria, default 8% behavior, if i click on any of the stock in the table, the stock code will be automated input into Order Assistant, and the stock will show in charting 

3. Charting - a tradingview like charting function
basically candlestick bar chart with price, volume and a few technical indicators
behavior: showing bar chart base on the stock code in order assistant
show a horizontal line that indicating the entry and sl and tp price level on the order assistant,
i can move the line to adjust the corresponding value in Order Assistant 
TAs: by default showing 5, 10, 21 ema; 50, 100, 200 ma, vwap lines
can be toggle between 1mins, 3mins, 5mins, 15mins, 1 hours, 4 hours, 1 Day bar chart 

Help me to create a plan to build a trading app with below requirements. Let me know if there's any think missing in the requirements. Let me confirm with the plan on any changes. Focus on the Order Assistant first to make sure it is working, and then screener, and charting come last. Create a checking list base on the implementation plan on task needs to be done. Update the task list base on our conversation and plans, and indicate their progress: done, WIP, not started.

## üí∞ Price Extraction System (Critical Architecture)

Our trading app extracts prices from **multiple sources** with comprehensive validation. This system is fundamental to accurate order execution and risk management.

### 1. **Entry Price (Order Assistant)**

#### Manual Entry (Primary Method)
- **Source**: User input via `ImprovedDoubleSpinBox`
- **Default Value**: $1.00 (set in constructor)
- **Location**: `src/ui/order_assistant.py:174`
```python
self.entry_price.setValue(1.00)  # Default entry price: $1.00
```

#### Auto-Population from "Fetch Price" Button
- **Source**: IB Market Data API via `data_fetcher.get_price_and_stops()`
- **Method**: `ib.reqMktData()` synchronous call
- **Priority Order**:
  1. `ticker.last` (most recent trade)
  2. `ticker.close` (previous close)
  3. `(ticker.bid + ticker.ask) / 2` (mid-point)
- **Location**: `src/core/data_fetcher.py:311-321`

### 2. **Stop Loss Prices (Historical Data Integration)**

#### Prior 5-Minute Bar Low
- **Source**: IB Historical Data API
- **Method**: `ib.reqHistoricalData()` with `'5 mins'` bars
- **Logic**: Uses `bars_5min[-2]` (second-to-last bar = most recent completed)
- **Smart Adjustment**: Subtracts 0.01 (stocks ‚â•$1) or 0.0001 (stocks <$1)
- **Location**: `src/core/data_fetcher.py:336-396`
```python
bars_5min = ib.reqHistoricalData(contract, durationStr='1 D', barSizeSetting='5 mins')
prior_bar = bars_5min[-2]  # Most recent completed bar
stop_levels['prior_5min_low'] = prior_bar.low
```

#### Current 5-Minute Bar Low
- **Source**: Same as above, but uses `bars_5min[-1]` (current incomplete bar)
- **Location**: `src/core/data_fetcher.py:374-382`

#### Day Low
- **Source**: IB Historical Data API with daily bars
- **Method**: `ib.reqHistoricalData()` with `'1 day'` bars
- **Logic**: Uses `bars_daily[-1].low` (current day's low)
- **Location**: `src/core/data_fetcher.py:407-428`
```python
bars_daily = ib.reqHistoricalData(contract, durationStr='5 D', barSizeSetting='1 day')
stop_levels['day_low'] = bars_daily[-1].low
```

#### Percentage-Based Stops
- **Source**: Calculated from entry price
- **Formula**: 
  - **LONG**: `entry_price * (1 - percentage/100)`
  - **SHORT**: `entry_price * (1 + percentage/100)`
- **Location**: `src/ui/order_assistant.py:997-1000`

### 3. **Market Screener Prices (Real-Time Data)**

#### Real Market Data (via "Real $" Button)
- **Source**: IB Market Data API for scanner symbols
- **Method**: `market_screener._fetch_current_prices()`
- **Process**:
  1. Creates contracts for top 5 symbols from scanner
  2. Calls `ib.reqMktData()` for each
  3. Waits 2 seconds for data population
  4. Extracts prices with same priority as entry price
- **Location**: `src/core/market_screener.py:279-380`

#### Scanner Data (Attempted but Usually Empty)
- **Source**: TWS Scanner API fields
- **Fields Checked**: `result.distance`, `result.benchmark`
- **Reality**: These fields are usually empty from IB Scanner
- **Fallback**: Shows `N/A` when no real data available (honest approach)
- **Location**: `src/core/market_screener.py:414-428`

### 4. **Price Validation & Compliance (Critical for Order Execution)**

#### Enhanced Multi-Layer Price Validation System (Prevents Corruption & IB Errors)
- **Purpose**: Ensure all prices meet IB's increment requirements AND prevent data corruption
- **Layer 1 - Input Validation**: 
  - Validates price data at source in `process_price_data()` 
  - Rejects prices outside reasonable range (0 < price ‚â§ $5,000)
  - Location: `main.py:766-791`
- **Layer 2 - UI Range Limits**: 
  - QDoubleSpinBox maximum ranges reduced from $10,000 to $5,000
  - Prevents extreme values from being set via UI
  - Location: `src/ui/order_assistant.py:224, 261, 292`
- **Layer 3 - Change Handler Protection**: 
  - Circuit breaker in `on_entry_price_changed()` detects extreme values
  - Automatically resets corrupted values to safe defaults ($1.00)
  - Location: `src/ui/order_assistant.py:689-701`
- **Layer 4 - Auto-Adjustment Safety**: 
  - Enhanced validation in `auto_adjust_take_profit()` prevents extreme calculations
  - Risk distance validation prevents processing unreasonable stop loss distances
  - Location: `src/ui/order_assistant.py:1472-1498`
- **Layer 5 - Tick Size Compliance**: 
  - **Stocks ‚â• $1.00**: Round to 2 decimals (penny increments)
  - **Stocks < $1.00**: Round to 4 decimals (sub-penny allowed)
  - Applied to all price fields before order submission
  - Location: `src/ui/order_assistant.py:83-93` and `src/core/order_manager.py`

```python
def round_to_tick_size(self, price: float) -> float:
    if price >= 1.0:
        return round(price, 2)  # Penny increments
    else:
        return round(price, 4)  # Sub-penny allowed

def _validate_price(self, price: float, price_type: str) -> bool:
    """Multi-layer validation for price corruption prevention"""
    if price < 0.01 or price > 5000.0:
        logger.error(f"Invalid {price_type} price: ${price:.2f}")
        return False
    return True
```

### 5. **Data Quality & Source Tracking**

#### Source Indicators
- **REAL**: Actual market data from IB API
- **NO_DATA**: No data available (shows honest N/A)
- **Location**: `src/core/market_screener.py:499`

#### Data Honesty Policy
- **Previous**: Random hash-based fake estimates ‚ùå **REMOVED**
- **Current**: Honest `N/A` display when no data available ‚úÖ
- **Philosophy**: Never mislead users with fake calculated data

### 6. **Performance Characteristics**

#### Latency Benchmarks
- **Entry Price Fetch**: ~300ms (includes historical data for stops)
- **Market Screener Real Prices**: ~2-3 seconds (fetches 5 symbols)
- **Stop Loss Calculations**: ~1-2 seconds (historical bar data)
- **Price Validation**: <5ms (automatic tick size rounding)

### 7. **Error Handling & Fallback Strategy**

#### Connection Issues
- **Fallback**: Shows previous data or N/A
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages in status labels

#### Data Unavailable
- **No Historical Data**: Uses estimated stops based on percentage
- **No Market Data**: Shows N/A instead of fake values
- **Network Timeout**: Graceful degradation with cached data

### 8. **Price Data Flow Architecture**

```
User Action ‚Üí Data Source ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Display/Use
    ‚Üì            ‚Üì             ‚Üì           ‚Üì          ‚Üì

Real $ ‚Üí Market Data ‚Üí 5 Symbols ‚Üí None ‚Üí Screener Table
Manual ‚Üí User Input ‚Üí None ‚Üí Tick Round ‚Üí Order Submission
```

### 9. **Critical Implementation Details**

#### Market Data Priority Logic
```python
# Price extraction priority (used throughout app)
if ticker.last and ticker.last > 0:
    price = ticker.last              # Most recent trade
elif ticker.close and ticker.close > 0:
    price = ticker.close             # Previous close
elif ticker.bid and ticker.ask:
    price = (ticker.bid + ticker.ask) / 2  # Mid-point
else:
    price = None  # Honest N/A display
```

#### Historical Bar Logic
```python
# Stop loss from historical data
if len(bars_5min) >= 2:
    prior_bar = bars_5min[-2]        # Completed bar
    current_bar = bars_5min[-1]      # Incomplete bar
    stop_levels['prior_5min_low'] = prior_bar.low
    stop_levels['current_5min_low'] = current_bar.low
```

This comprehensive price extraction system ensures **accurate, validated, and honest** price data throughout the trading application while maintaining low latency and robust error handling. It forms the foundation for reliable order execution and risk management.

### Design Patterns Used
- **Singleton**: IB Connection Manager ensures single connection
- **Observer**: Real-time updates for prices and account values
- **Strategy**: Different risk calculation methods
- **Factory**: Order creation for different types
- **Repository**: Data access abstraction for IB API

### UI Enhancements
- **ImprovedDoubleSpinBox**: Custom widget fixing Qt selection issues
- **3-Panel Layout**: Order Assistant | Charting (Future) | Market Screener
- **Smart Stop Loss Buttons**: Context-aware pricing based on stock value
- **Quick Adjustments**: +/- buttons for rapid price modifications
- **Mode Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for Paper vs Live trading
